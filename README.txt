# README

Study Connect is an app that streamlines the creation of a university network by matching students seeking academic help with peers able to provide assistance, fostering a more collaborative learning environment.

## Group 1 - Study Connect

No third-party Java sources were used in the development of Study Connect. The application integrates Firebase for server-side operations, specifically using Firestore for database services, Firebase Authentication for user validation, and Firebase Storage for file management. Full access to the Firebase project is granted to the lecturer on email m.seraj@tue.nl and can be accessed via https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/studyconnect-g1/overview.

The project was managed through this GitHub repository: https://github.com/AlexanderIvanovTUE/StudyConnect_G1.git, with the lecturer having been provided access.
